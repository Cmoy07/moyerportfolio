                            Hi my name is Caden! I'm currently a Senior at Adrian High School, with aspirations of becoming a developer!
                            My journey into the programming began when I was young child. I remember watching Minecraft gameplay on Youtube
                            and thinking, "How in the world was this game created, and how can I make something like this?"
                            I never really explored that curiosity until later, when I got into high school. 
                            That is when I decided to start taking classes that delve into my interests; allowing me to engage in what I love.
                            Now, I whole-heartily believe that becoming a developer is my purpose in life. 
                        </p>
                        <p class = "about_p">
                            I'm driven by the idea that I can create programs that can better peoples lives, either by giving them an
                            escape for a few hours, or a space to help them be more productive. Currently I'm working with HTML/ CSS to
                            design dynamic webpages, that are responsive and interactive. I enjoy working with Python to create interactive programs,
                            which spans from web-scrappers, and interpreting the data, to designing games. My goal in the future is to become an effective developer,
                            by learning new languages and proficiency in my current languages. In doing this, I hope to work on projects that impact peoples lives.
                        </p>

                            Outside of the world of programming, you'll probably find me fishing or hanging out with my friends. I believe that
                            the same sense of community I have in my personal life should also be prevalent in my work life.
