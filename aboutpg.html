                            Hi my name is Caden! I'm currently a Senior at Adrian High School, with aspirations of becoming a developer!
                            My journey into the programming began when I was young child. I remember watching Minecraft gameplays on Youtube
                            and thinking, "How in the world was this game created, and how can I make something like this?"
                            I never really explored that curiosity until later, when I got into high school. 
                            That is when I decided to start taking classes that delve into my interests; allowing me to engage in what I love.
                            Now, I whole-heartly believe that becoming a developer is my purpose in life. 
                        </p>

                            I'm driven by the idea that I can create programs that can better peoples lives, either by giving them an
                            escape for a few hours, or a space to help them be more productive.
